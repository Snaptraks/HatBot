# Halloween Cog

The assets used in the Cog were taken form the Trick'cord Treat event that Discord hosted in 2020. I can't find the original links except for this Facebook post: https://www.facebook.com/discord/posts/meet-trickcord-treat-bottrick-or-treaters-will-appear-and-youll-have-the-chance-/3552761228124915/

So thanks to whoever made the art, they are really awesome, and made this possible!
